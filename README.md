I'm a 18-year-old developer passionate about programming, web technologies and hardware. 

I started my journey into the programming world at the age of 15 and since then I have been dedicated to learning and building new things. Currently, I'm focusing on improving my skills in Node.js and other Javascript tools.

In my free time, I play online games, read books, and listen to music of all types. This keeps my mind fresh and helps me approach problems from different angles.

Some projects:
